# Raman spectroscopy for biological samples

Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive method commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. The Raman spectra collected from biological materials can be complex and is an ongoing area of reseach in chemometrics. 

## Raman spectroscopy for assessing tissue engineered products

Single cell and tissue spectra were collected using a commercial Raman spectrometer. Preprocessing is performed using the hyperSpec R package (Beleites and Sergo). Power et al. (2020) show how machine learning can be used to interpret complex Raman spectra collected from native and engineered tissues. 

Highlights
- Real-world example of implementing Raman spectroscopy-based QCs in a GMP setting.
- Novel application of Raman spectroscopy for the development of tissue identity assays.
- The maturity of engineered cartilage can be sensed even with collagen scaffolds.
- Statistical learning allows for the advanced interpretability of Raman spectra.
